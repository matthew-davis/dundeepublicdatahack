# Dundee Public Data Hack: Team Michael

## What is this?
[My](https://github.com/andmikey) contributions to Dundee Public Data Hack 2018. 

## What's here?
The interesting bits of [my work on the day](https://github.com/andmikey/data-jam-2018). 

There are two notebooks:

1. **Explorations.ipynb**

  A notebook exploring the car accident statistics dataset in Dundee, for 2004-2016. 
  
  I investigate three hypotheses:
  
    i. Are serious or fatal accidents more likely in bad weather?
      Answer: No, p > 0.05
    ii. Are serious or fatal accidents more likely during the night?
      Answer: Yes, p < 0.05
    iii. Do any times of day, days of week, or months of year have more serious or fatal accidents?
      Answer: Yes:
        1. Times of day: More accidents happen during morning and evening commute times (7am-8am and 4pm-5pm respectively), and a more minor peak at lunchtime (noon-1pm)
        2. Days of week: Friday, by a small margin.
        3. Months of year: December has the highest peak. 
        
2. **Visualisations.ipynb**

  A notebook visualising various interesting datasets.
  
  The visualisations include:
    1. The locations and severities of car accidents in Dundee
    
    2. The locations of cameras in Dundee, and Voronoi diagrams showing the nearest camera to you at a given location
    
    3. The locations and food safety ratings of restaurants in Dundee
    
    4. The locations of monuments in Dundee, color coded by the amount of time it takes to walk to them from Dundee train station (DEE) 
    
    
Running the second notebook all the way through will produce a number of visualisations in HTML.
